# Section 1: Motivation and Purpose
Who we are: Non Profit Mental Health Organization

Target Audience: Employers in the technological sector around the world

With the overabundance of information and stress in our modern society, more and more people are affected by some kind of mental illness. These mental illness include anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and personality disorder etc. One of the many contributor in developing a mental illness is the stress faced at the workplace. Out of all different industry, one can argue that working in the technological industry would be the most stress inducing. With our fast changing technology in modern society, employers in the tech industry often force their employees to work unreasonable hours or develop new technology in a short amount of time without considering their employee's mental state. Hence, the poor working environment can often become the number one contributor in developing mental illness. This is particularly true in most Asian countries where the employers will often demand overtime from their workers. Thus, the aim of our app is to present the statistics of people who worked in the tech sector and the frequency of mental illness among these people across different demographics and work cultures. We hope that by presenting these statistics, employers around the world can stop overlooking this issue and create a less stress inducing workplace.




# Section 2: Description of the data

This app will visualize the dataset that contains information on approximately 1200 individuals who work in the tech industry around the world. In the dataset, each row represents an individual and has information regarding their demographics, workplace environmnent, and their intiatives in dealing with mental illness. Whether the person has mental illness is indicated by the `treatment` column. In our app, we will investigate the distribution of the counts of mental illnessess across different countries as well as other demographics among these individuals. Another interesting aspect that is worth investigating is whether these individuals who are afflicted by mental illnessess have family history since the illness could be possibly passed down from the parents. Next, we will explore relationship between mental illness and attributes of workplace environment. Finally, we want to see whether these individuals seeked any help regarding their illnessess. In terms of demographic information, we will be using the columns `Age`, `Country`, `Gender`, and `family history` etc. Columns that describe workplace environment include `no_employees`, `remote_work`, `benefits`, `care_options`, `mentalhealthconsequence` and `mentalvsphysical` etc. Finally, we will use columns such as `coworkers`, `supervisor`, and `mentalhealthinterview` etc to investigate whether employers seeked any help.
